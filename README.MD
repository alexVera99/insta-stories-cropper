# Description
This project borns while using the videos in Spotify. You may have seen that while listening some songs, the original video of the song appears also. The point is that such videos where not edited for 9:16 ratio displays (in other words, mobile displays in vertical). And, those videos were showing the faces of the people that were in the video singing. 

But, the point is that manually editing a video to follow faces is not a nice task. Then, I asked myself how do the people at Spotify did this.

So, here it is. This project aims to crop a video following faces. In fact, it can be used to any w:h ratio, where w is width and h is height.

For instance, imagine you have this video:
<p align="center">
    <video controls>
        <source src="videos/2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
</p>
